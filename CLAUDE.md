# GrowFi — Claude Code guide

Permissionless RegenFi protocol: farmers/cooperatives tokenise a future harvest as $CAMPAIGN, stakers earn $YIELD, at harvest holders redeem $YIELD for physical product (Merkle proof) or pro-rata USDC.

## Contract suite (one per campaign)

| Contract | Role |
|---|---|
| `Campaign` | Funding escrow, sales, buyback-on-failure, sell-back queue, state machine (Funding → Active → {Buyback, Ended}) |
| `CampaignToken` | ERC20Votes, mint/burn gated to Campaign (+ StakingVault for penalty burns) |
| `StakingVault` | Stake $CAMPAIGN, earn $YIELD via Synthetix accumulator; linear early-unstake penalty; per-season accrual tracking |
| `YieldToken` | ERC20, mint by Vault, burn by Vault + HarvestManager |
| `HarvestManager` | Producer reports harvest → Merkle proof redemption for product OR pro-rata USDC redemption with partial deposits |

Wiring happens once, atomically, in `CampaignFactory.createCampaign`. Circular deps (`Campaign ↔ CampaignToken ↔ StakingVault ↔ YieldToken ↔ HarvestManager`) resolved via one-shot setters guarded by `AlreadySet` custom errors.

## Trust model

- **Permissionless factory**: `createCampaign` is NOT `onlyOwner`. Anyone can launch; `require(params.producer == msg.sender)` prevents squatting someone else's campaign.
- **Producer** (immutable per campaign): whitelists payment tokens, runs season lifecycle, reports harvest, deposits USDC.
- **Factory owner** (`Ownable2Step`): only controls `protocolFeeRecipient` for *future* campaigns and emergency `pauseCampaign / unpauseCampaign`. Existing campaigns snapshot feeRecipient immutably at creation.
- **No other roles.** All state transitions on-chain.

## Critical invariants (asserted by `test/invariant/Invariants.t.sol`)

1. `stakingVault.totalStaked() == campaignToken.balanceOf(stakingVault)`
2. `sum(pendingSellBack[users]) == getSellBackQueueDepth()`
3. `currentSupply - totalSupply == ghost_totalBurned` (penalties/buyback)
4. `openSellBackCount[user] ≤ MAX_OPEN_SELLBACK_ORDERS_PER_USER` (50)
5. `yieldToken.totalSupply() ≤ Σ season.totalYieldOwed` (with O(positions) floor drift tolerance)

Invariant config: `runs = 256, depth = 128, fail_on_revert = false` → ~33k random sequences per invariant.

## Gotchas (audit-era learnings)

- `depositUSDC(amount)` always splits **98% → pool, 2% → feeRecipient** on every deposit. Producer sizes the gross via `HarvestManager.remainingDepositGross(seasonId)`.
- Oracle-mode payment tokens must have `decimals() ≤ 18` (enforced at `addAcceptedToken`). `TokenConfig.paymentDecimals` is cached; pricing math scales by `10^(18 - paymentDecimals)`.
- On L2, `CampaignFactory` MUST be deployed with the Chainlink sequencer-uptime feed as the 4th constructor arg. `address(0)` on L1. Feed addresses:
  - Arbitrum One: `0xFdB631F5EE196F0ed6FAa767959853A9F217697D`
  - Base Mainnet: `0xBCF85224fc0756B9Fa45aA7892530B47e10b6433`
- `HarvestManager.reportHarvest` reads `stakingVault.seasonTotalYieldOwed(seasonId)` — do NOT revert to `yieldToken.totalSupply()`; late claims would oversubscribe.
- `StakingVault.unstake` is intentionally NOT `whenNotPaused` — principal exit must always remain available. Only `stake/restake/claimYield` pause.
- `Campaign.buyback` is intentionally NOT `whenNotPaused` — emergency refund path for failed campaigns.
- **Never use `yieldToken.totalSupply()` as a harvest denominator.** Always `stakingVault.seasonTotalYieldOwed(id)`.

## Public views for UI / indexers

- `Campaign.previewBuy(token, paymentAmount) → (tokensOut, effectivePayment, oraclePrice)` — handles maxCap crop + oracle decimals. Does NOT simulate sellback queue fills (fills are supply-neutral).
- `Campaign.getPrice(token, campaignAmount)` — inverse: how much payment for N $CAMPAIGN.
- `HarvestManager.remainingDepositGross(seasonId)` — gross USDC producer must still send to fully cover `usdcOwed`, already factoring the 98/2 fee split.
- `StakingVault.seasonTotalYieldOwed(seasonId)` — canonical per-season yield snapshot (accrued minus forfeits).
- `Campaign.getSellBackQueueDepth()` — total $CAMPAIGN currently queued for sell-back.

## Dev commands

```bash
forge build                                       # compile (solc 0.8.24, via_ir)
forge test --no-match-path "test/fork/*"          # 123 local tests, ~15s
forge test --match-path "test/invariant/*"        # 11 invariants, ~7 min at 256×128
forge test --match-path "test/fork/*"              # needs RPC; skips gracefully
forge test --match-contract AuditFixesTest -vv    # audit regression suite
forge snapshot                                     # gas baseline
```

## Conventions

- Tests use `vm.prank(producer)` before every `factory.createCampaign(...)` call because of the permissionless-model producer check. If you add a new test suite, remember this or setUp reverts with `"producer must be caller"`.
- Custom errors preferred over string reverts on setters / validation paths.
- Never use `_paymentToTokens` (removed) — it duplicated `_calculateTokensOut` with drift risk. Use the queue-return pattern instead.
- New numerical invariants go into `Invariants.t.sol`, not individual test files, so they benefit from the full 33k-sequence fuzz.

## Audit history
